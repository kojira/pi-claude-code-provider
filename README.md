# pi-claude-code-provider

## Optional hermit-shell connection (experimental)

If a separately operated [hermit-shell](https://github.com/kojira/hermit-shell) proxy is available on the same host, set `PI_HERMIT_SHELL_PROVIDER_ENABLED=1` before starting Pi. This adds a distinct `hermit-shell` provider at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/v1` (override the port with `PI_HERMIT_SHELL_PORT`). It does not replace the existing Claude Code provider or access Claude credentials; hermit-shell owns authentication and Anthropic request caching. Only configure this for a trusted local proxy, and do not expose an unauthenticated proxy to the network. The proxy must forward Anthropic cache-read and cache-write counts in OpenAI `prompt_tokens_details` for Pi usage to reflect cache effectiveness. The model list is currently Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.6, Opus 5.5 (as advertised by the local proxy), and Haiku 4.5; thinking blocks are not exposed by the proxy's OpenAI conversion. Validate actual cache reuse before migrating long sessions.

A [Pi](https://pi.dev) package that creates a provider for Claude family models from a subscription-authenticated Claude Code installation by launching Anthropic's installed `claude` executable in documented non-interactive print mode. Pi remains fully in charge of the session: branching, compaction, and history behave like any other Pi provider, and every tool runs visibly in Pi — the Claude process can propose tool calls but never execute anything on its own. The goal is simple: the convenience of your Claude subscription in Pi, with the fewest possible surprises.

This package never imitates private OAuth traffic, does not use the Agents SDK, and does not modify Claude's internal session files. It never reads Claude credentials or uses an Anthropic API key.

This project was developed using frontier AI models under human guidance. Almost all of the docs and code were written by machines except for this introductory material. The project may be over-engineered in some respects; that's fine. If you enjoy this package, please star it on github.

## Requirements

- [Pi](https://pi.dev), installed from npm or a standalone build
- A current Claude Code installation; see the [tested compatibility baseline](DEVELOPING.md#compatibility-baseline)
- Claude Code logged in to an eligible Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise claude.ai subscription
- Node.js 22.19 or newer only when Pi itself is installed from npm; the standalone build needs no separate Node installation

Pi ships as an npm package that runs on Node and as a compiled standalone binary that embeds Bun. Both are supported: the package launches its tool-proposal bridge under whichever runtime is hosting Pi rather than assuming Node. The standalone build carries its own live gate, which has passed on Linux x64; the table in [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md#compatibility-baseline) records the exact scope. Run `/pi-claude-code-provider-doctor` on either build: it reports the resolved runtime and completes a real bridge handshake.

See the [compatibility baseline](DEVELOPING.md#compatibility-baseline) for tested versions and platforms. Other platforms continue with a warning and runtime capability checks.

The provider rejects API-key authentication, alternate Anthropic base URLs, and Bedrock, Vertex, or Foundry routing. If `claude` is not on `PATH`, set `PI_CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_PATH` to its executable path.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-claude-code-provider
```

To install directly from GitHub's default branch:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/chem/pi-claude-code-provider
```

Add `-l` for a project-local installation. Pi loads project packages only after the project is trusted; use `pi config` to enable or disable the extension.

## Use

Open `/model` and choose one of these aliases: `default`, `sonnet`, `fable`, `fable-5.1`, `opus`, `opus-5.5`, or `haiku`. Pi displays them with the provider name, for example `sonnet [pi-claude-code-provider]`.

To select one directly:

```text
/model pi-claude-code-provider/sonnet
```

The same canonical reference works from the command line with `pi --model pi-claude-code-provider/sonnet`.

Pi maps its exposed thinking levels to Claude's `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max` effort values; unsupported levels are hidden. Opus uses a 200K context window on Pro and 1M on Max, Team, and Enterprise. The provider retains 200K on Pro even when Claude Code reports a 1M-capable variant, because it cannot determine credit availability.

The `fable` and `fable-5.1` aliases are offered and separately testable, but they are excluded from the paid release gate. `fable-5.1` is translated to Claude Code's canonical `claude-fable-5-1` model name. Fable availability, included allocation, and billing vary by subscription tier. The aliases otherwise follow the standard model path wherever the account allows them. See Anthropic's [Fable plan policy](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/15424964-claude-fable-5-on-your-plan).

The `opus-5.5` alias is translated to Claude Code's canonical `claude-opus-5-5` model name and shares the Opus context-window rule above. It is selectable and separately testable but excluded from the paid release gate.

**Model identity:** self-identification is generated text, not routing metadata, and Pi's coding-tool prompt and schemas can make Claude name an older Sonnet even when Claude Code served Opus. Use the assistant message's `responseModel` field in Pi's JSON output for the served model; Pi's status line shows the requested alias.

After installation or an upstream update, run:

```text
/pi-claude-code-provider-doctor
```

Run `/pi-claude-code-provider-doctor report` to write a bounded, content-free JSON diagnostic report in a private temporary directory. Inspect the report before sharing it.

The package also registers `pi_claude_code_provider_web_search`, a visible Pi tool that runs Claude with only WebSearch and WebFetch. It is skipped with a warning if another extension already owns that name. Truncated full results are removed at session shutdown.

## Subscription usage

Provider and web-search requests consume Claude subscription capacity. A cancellation received before Claude is launched starts no Claude request; a request already running can consume capacity before termination. Optional usage credits may incur additional spend after plan limits. The package reports Claude's token counts when available and reports zero monetary cost because it cannot determine how a subscription request was billed.

Anthropic documents [`claude -p` / `--print`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference) as its non-interactive CLI interface, explains that [third-party usage draws from subscription limits](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/15036540-use-the-claude-agent-sdk-with-your-claude-plan), and documents [subscription authentication and usage credits](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11145838-use-claude-code-with-your-pro-or-max-plan). This project uses that public interface without claiming Anthropic endorsement.

Rate-limit warnings and reset times appear as Pi notifications when Claude provides them, including for web-search requests, and each distinct notice is reported once per session. Utilization is displayed using Claude Code's whole-percent convention. Overage status is reported only when it constrains the request, so a plan with usage credits disabled produces no notification while its own limits are healthy.

## Compatibility limitation

Claude Code's public headless protocol cannot accept arbitrary historical assistant and tool-result messages, so the provider sends Pi's complete current history as an append-stable semantic transcript on every request. Pi remains authoritative for branching, compaction, reloads, and provider handoff; the transport is not wire-equivalent to Anthropic's Messages API, consumes additional context, and leaves prompt-cache keys and retention to Claude.

## Configuration

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PI_CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_PATH` | Override the `claude` executable path. |
| `PI_CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_METRICS_LOG` | Append content-free request and search metrics as JSONL. |
| `PI_CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` | Override the five-minute protocol-idle timeout with positive milliseconds. |
| `PI_CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_TOTAL_TIMEOUT_MS` | Override the 30-minute total timeout with positive milliseconds. |
| `PI_CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_MCP_READY_TIMEOUT_MS` | Override the five-second tool-catalog readiness timeout with positive milliseconds. |

Metrics exclude prompts, messages, queries, output, credentials, stderr, and temporary paths. On POSIX, the log is kept at mode 0600; Windows uses the selected location's ACL.

## Security and troubleshooting

Pi packages run with the user's permissions; review the source before installation and treat model-visible context like any other Claude Code prompt. Main requests suppress unmanaged user and project customizations and local tools, validate capabilities, and remove private request state before success. Administrator-managed Claude Code settings, hooks, and MCP policy are organization-trusted and can take effect before validation; abrupt host termination can still leave state behind. See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the security model and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting.

- **Provider missing:** run the doctor, correct the reported problem, then run `/reload`.
- **Authentication rejected:** run `claude auth status` and log in with an eligible first-party subscription.
- **Compatibility warning:** compare the installed versions with [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md#compatibility-baseline).
- **Search unavailable:** allow `pi_claude_code_provider_web_search` in Pi's tool filters and check for a name collision.
- **`pi auth check` reports `provider_not_found`:** that command does not load extensions, so it cannot see any extension-registered provider. Use `/pi-claude-code-provider-doctor` to check readiness.
- **Tool proposals never arrive, or requests fail with `mcp_startup`:** run `/pi-claude-code-provider-doctor`. It reports the exact bridge argument vector and whether the handshake completed. Raising `PI_CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_MCP_READY_TIMEOUT_MS` only helps when the handshake succeeds but is slow.
- **Stale Windows state after an abrupt exit or `process_cleanup` failure:** a cleanup failure deliberately retains its marked directory when Claude process death is uncertain. Stop the relevant Pi and Claude processes, locate the temporary directory (`node -p "require('node:os').tmpdir()"`, or `echo %TEMP%` when Pi is the standalone build and Node is absent), inspect package marker files, and remove only confirmed stale directories.
