# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add a `fable-5.1` picker alias that invokes Claude Code's canonical `claude-fable-5-1` model name, with a separate opt-in paid validation gate.
- Add an `opus-5.5` picker alias that invokes Claude Code's canonical `claude-opus-5-5` model name, with a separate opt-in paid validation gate.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- Restore prompt-cache reuse broken by Claude Code 2.1.233's undocumented, changing token reminder. The provider now applies the maintainer-recommended `totalTokensReminder: "off"` setting; the cache gate verifies reuse across fresh processes.
- Honor Pi's per-request output limit, including compact 2,048-token branch-summary requests, while clamping it to the model maximum and reserving the same amount in context checks.
- Fail clearly on sanitized MCP initialization errors, malformed provider-hook payloads, near-match CLI options, oversized in-flight bridge requests, and process-tree termination failures. Cleanup errors now preserve the original failure, settle promptly, and retain the owned marker when process liveness is unknown.

### Changed

- Simplify transport guidance and child configuration, report bridge launches as structured argument vectors, and share Claude protocol/runtime helpers across provider, search, diagnostics, and tests.
- Update the verified baseline to Pi 0.84.2 and Claude Code 2.1.241.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- Launch the proposal bridge through Pi's actual host runtime. Standalone Pi builds now use their embedded Bun runtime with a neutral pinned `bunfig.toml`, fixing tool proposals and preventing working-directory preload configuration.

### Added

- Add a real bridge handshake to the doctor and diagnostic report.
- Add npm and standalone bridge live gates, selectable with `PI_CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_PI_BIN`.

### Changed

- Include dates in rate-limit reset notices.
- Add resolved bridge and bounded stderr context to MCP startup failures.
- Diagnose standalone Pi as a supported runtime but unsupported development host.
- Verify Pi 0.84.2, Claude Code 2.1.237, and standalone Pi on Linux x64.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- Report a rate limit only when one constrains the request. A rejected overage no longer overrides a healthy plan window, so a subscription with usage credits disabled at the account level no longer warns on every request, and the reported window name and utilization are preserved.
- Report each distinct rate-limit notice once per session rather than once per Claude process, which this transport starts for every tool round-trip.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- Add `PI_CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_MCP_READY_TIMEOUT_MS` to override the five-second MCP tool-catalog readiness timeout.

### Changed

- Verify the existing `opus` alias resolves to Claude Opus 5, retain its safe 200K Pro context limit, and update the verified baseline to Pi 0.84.1 and Claude Code 2.1.226.
- Improve provider and web-search rate-limit notifications with whole-percent utilization, reset times, and overage status.
- Align with Pi's provider lifecycle: stream partial responses as `pending` and invoke and await `after_provider_response` observers before publishing content.

### Fixed

- Improve web-search cancellation and cleanup: do not launch Claude for a pre-cancelled request, and recover stale private output left by abrupt exits.
- Tolerate newer Claude Code result, stop-reason, and advisory rate-limit envelopes while preserving useful error diagnostics.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-19
